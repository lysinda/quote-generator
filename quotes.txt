If it doesn't challenge you, it doesn't change you.
If you cannot find peace within yourself, you will never find it anywhere else.
Worrying does not take away tomorrow's troubles, it takes away today's peace.
If you want to be happy, set a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy, and inspires your hopes.
Each day wake up and ask yourself what will make you feel most alive that day.
Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.
The best climber in the world is the one who's having the most fun.
